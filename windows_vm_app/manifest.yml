  This app will launch a Microsoft Windows virtual machine on a compute node. You will
  have no internet access, but all directories you have permission to access will be mapped
  in the Windows File Explorer. It may take 10-15 seconds for this mapping to activate.
  It will also take approximately 2 minutes for the VM to start and you will see a Connect
  button when it is ready.

  We strongly recommend launching this job with the minimum resources below - 
  CPUs - 4 cores
  Memory - 32GB (use Advanced Options checkbox)

  Currently this VM only has the Microsoft Office suite installed. Let us know at 
  helpdesk@chpc.utah.edu if there are other applications you would like to see available.
