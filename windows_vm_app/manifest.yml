  This app will launch a Microsoft Windows virtual machine on a compute node. 
  It will take approximately 2 minutes for the VM to start and you will see a Connect
  button when it is ready. You will have no internet access, but all directories you have 
  permission to access will be mapped in the Windows File Explorer. 
  It may take 10-15 seconds for this mapping to activate after you login to the machine.
  
  IMPORTANT: Do not use the VM's internal drives (C:. D:) for storage because that information will
  NOT be saved between VM sessions. Always use the mapped drives for your work (home, scratch, etc).

  We strongly recommend launching this job with the minimum resources below - 
  CPUs - 4 cores
  Memory - 32GB (use Advanced Options checkbox)

  Currently this VM only has the Microsoft Office suite installed. Let us know at 
  helpdesk@chpc.utah.edu if there are other applications you would like to see available.
