  This app provides [Jupyter] Notebook or Lab interface to [Generative Protein Binder Design] based on Nvidia Inference Microservices ([NIM]).
  See [example notebook] for basic functionality.

  NOTE: You need to use your own [NGC API key]. Choose three least mid-size GPUs (>=48 GB RAM), 32 CPUs and 256 GB RAM. notchpeak-gpu-guest with 3xA40 works well for the example.

  LIMITS: The four NIMs use fixed ports so no other NIM should be running on the same node.
 
  [GPU specification] is optional for the clusters and partitions that have them.
