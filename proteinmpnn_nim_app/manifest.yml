  This app will launch a [ProteinMPNN] Nvidia Inference server ([NIM]) with a [Jupyter] Notebook or Lab server using [Python] on a [HPC
  cluster] or on a [Frisco node]. See [example notebook] for basic functionality.

  For smaller sequences, performance seems reasonable on CPUs, for larger sequences, a GPU may be needed.
 
  To start the job promptly, use notchpeak-shared-short account and partition on the [Notchpeak cluster]. 

  [GPU specification] is optional for the clusters and partitions that have them.
