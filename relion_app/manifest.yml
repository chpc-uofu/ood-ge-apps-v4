  This app will launch a [RELION] GUI on a [HPC cluster] or on a [Frisco node]. You
  will be able to interact with the RELION GUI through a VNC session.

  If you want to run the RELION analysis in a batch mode, please choose only single task 
  for this GUI launch. 

  NOTE: The CPU version of RELION is currently optimized for Notchpeak Intel nodes and does not run on Kingspeak, Lonepeak or Notchpeak AMD nodes.
