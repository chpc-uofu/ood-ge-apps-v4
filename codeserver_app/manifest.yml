  This app will launch a [VS Code] server using [Code Server] on a [HPC
  cluster] or on a [Frisco node].

  NOTE: VSCode Server does not allow additional authentication, which means that GitHub
  Copilot is not available. Please, use the VSCode Desktop app for that.

  [VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
  [Code Server]: https://coder.com/
  [HPC cluster]: https://www.chpc.utah.edu/resources/HPC_Clusters.php
  [Frisco node]: https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/guides/frisco-nodes.php
