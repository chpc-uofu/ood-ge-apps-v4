  This app will launch a [STARCCM+] GUI on a [HPC cluster] or on a [Frisco node]. You will be able
  to interact with the STARCCM+ GUI through a VNC session.

  [GPU specification] is optional for the partitions that have them.

  For parallel processing, choose `Parallel on Local Host` and set number of `Compute Processes` equal to `number of cores`.

  NOTE: Due to licensing, STARCCM+ is only available to Utah State University affiliates.
