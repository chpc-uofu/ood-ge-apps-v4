  cluster] or on a [Frisco node]. See [example notebooks] for basic functionality.

  NOTE: Choose appropriate resources for the chosen server, most need a GPU.
 
  To start the job promptly, use notchpeak-shared-short account and partition on the [Notchpeak cluster].

  [GPU specification] is optional for the clusters and partitions that have them.
