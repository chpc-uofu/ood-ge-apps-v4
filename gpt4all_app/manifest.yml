  This app will launch a [GPT4All] GUI on a [HPC cluster]. You will be able
  to interact with the MATLAB GUI through a VNC session.

  [GPU specification] is optional for the partitions that have them, but for good performance make sure to choose at least one GPU.
  To assist with immediate start of the job, choose notchpeak-shared-short account and partition, and either the 1080Ti or T4 GPUs. 
  1080Ti has 11.2 GB RAM, T4 has 15.3 GB RAM, and will fit models up that size.
