  This app will launch [RStudio Server] an IDE for [R] on one node of a [HPC cluster] or on a [Frisco node].
 
  To start the job promptly, use notchpeak-shared-short account and partition on the [Notchpeak cluster].

  [GPU specification] is optional for the partitions that have them.

  <b>NOTE:</b> For technical reasons only CHPC builds of the RStudio Server currently work on Frisco nodes. Please contact us for more information at helpdesk@chpc.utah.edu.
  <b>NOTE:</b> Due to potential excessive file storage needs, the RStudio temporary session files are stored in the /scratch/local and removed after the job terminates. Make sure to save your work space to your home or group directory if you need to save the work space.
